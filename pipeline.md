### At each stroke

#### 1. shape to cylinders - Chordal axis transform (CAT)

Getting the cylinders junction triangles and the chordal axis:
- Sample points along the shape for the Triangulation.
- Compute a **Constrained Delaunay Triangulation** of sampled points with the initial edges as the constraints.
- Compute the **chordal/medial axis** of the shape (maybe an approximation with Voronoi cells)
- We get the **junction triangles** from the triangulation as the triangles in which at least three medial axis are joined.

Refinement:
- We **prune** the chordal axis to remove unsignificant axis
- We apply **Laplacien smoothing** to
    - the chordal axis 
    - the **orientation** of internal edges of the triangulation (the chords), they become perpendicular to the chordal axis. (?)

Connecting region:
- The region between to junction triangles are merge with those triangles to form junction regions.

The result :
- a set of cylindrical regions
- a set of junction regions

#### 2. Generate the 3D surface

- The cylindrical regions are easily transformed into 3D cylinders :
  - the chordial axis are the cylinders axis
  - the chords become the radius of each cross section
  - adjacent cross sections are merge by triangles

- The junction regions to 3D ?

The entire mesh is then smoothed with **Least-squares Meshes** :
- The cylinders vertices are constrained
- The junction region vertices are unconstrained

#### 3. Generate the skeleton

**For the cylindrical regions:**
We down sample the chordal axis into **joints** and **bones**. To do so we use a modified version of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm : The Cylindrical Douglas-Peucker algorithm.

**For connecting regions:**
>A joint is placed at the center of each junction triangle and a bone is added across each of its three sides
> 
>If a side is adjacent to a cylindrical region, the bone is connected to the end of its skeleton; otherwise, the side must be adjacent
to another junction triangle, and the bone connects both junction
trianglesâ€™ centers

#### 4. Skin weights computation

The method listed in the `RigMesh` paper involves making bones radiating heat onto the surface, and the equilibrium temperature at
each vertex is computed by solving a linear system of equations.
